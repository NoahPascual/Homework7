// UML

// You will be creating a student class using the UML below. 
// In your Program.cs in the Main method, make 3 instances (objects) of the Student class using each type of constructor and then populate them with data (hard-coded). 
// Once you have populated them with data (including grades), output the students with all of the averages for their grades.
